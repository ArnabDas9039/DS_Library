# Data Structures' Library

I have created this C++ project with all the concepts of C++ that I have learned till today

## Abstract Data Types:

## Array: 
This is an example implementation of an Array which allocates its memory dynamically and so the user doesn't need to worry about how much space needs to be alloted before initialization. Initialization can also be done using variadic templates. This also contains iterators for traversing and can be directly printed like that of Python.
## Stack:
This is an example implementation of a Stack which inherits from Array.
## Queue: 
This is an example implementation of a Queue which inherits from Array.
## Heap: 
This is an example implementation of a Fibonucci Heap which inherits from Array. It is Min Heap by default, but can be changed as needed using the std::less<V> or any other comparator.
## List
This is an example implementation of an List. This is a Doubly Linked List and hence contains both a normal and a reverse Iterator.
## Pair
This is an example implementation of an Pair. It is nothing special and can also be implemented using a Struct.
## Map
This is an example implementation of an Map.
## Binary Tree
This is an example implementation of an Binary Tree. This contains different iterators like Preorder Traversal Iterator and Level Order Traversal Iterator.
## AVL Search Tree
This is an example implementation of an AVL Search Tree which inherits from Binary Tree.
## Ordered Map
This is an example implementation of an Ordered Map using an AVL Search Tree.
## Graph
This is an example implementation of an Graph using Array, List, Ordered Map, Map. This also contains different iterators like Depth First Traveral Iterator, Breadth First Traversal Iterator, Greedy Best First Traversal Iterator. It is in very early stage and the code may not work properly in many cases. Use with caution!

## Run Code

You can run this code using your own C++ compiler.

## Issues
If you find any issues regarding implementation details or how to run the code in your own computer, you can email me [here](arnabdas.9039@gmail.com).
